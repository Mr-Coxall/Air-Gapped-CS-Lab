# Raspberry Pi for TEJ4M

## Hardware

- raspberry pi 4 (or newer!)
- 32-bit no desktop (for simpler assembly isntruction set!)
- install NeoVim, from source to get the latest stable (in particular > v. 10, for Lua support)

## Set New User defaults

- goto ```/etc/skel```
  - this is the directory that is created for new users
- change .bashrc
  - add ```set -o vi```, to make Vim mode in the terminal
  - maybe this would be better: https://github.com/ardagnir/athame
